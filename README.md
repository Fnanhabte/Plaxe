   </h2>
   <P>
      The objective of this project is to design and develop a responsive website for a fictitious hotel chain called The Plaxe that delivers an exceptional user experience to potential guests. The website is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and designed to engage visitors with the features and amenities of Plaxe.

The website design focuses on showcasing the luxurious accommodations, exceptional dining options, and top-tier customer service offered by Plaxe. Additionally, it features social media integrations to encourage visitor engagement.

The website is built with responsive design principles, ensuring that it is accessible and optimized for viewing on various devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones. The responsive design will enable potential guests to access the website and view The Plaxe offerings regardless of the device they use.

      When it comes to hotel websites, however, it's true that many of them often fall short in terms of design. There are a few reasons for this ‚úçüèº
   </h1>
 <code> ‚ùå (1) Many hotel websites might have been developed years ago. As a result, they may not have kept up with the latest design trends and user expectations. Updating these websites to modern standards can be a significant undertaking, and some hotels may prioritize other areas of their business instead. </code>
<hr>
 <code> ‚ùå  (2) Hotels often have complex booking systems integrated into their websites, which can make the design process challenging. Balancing functionality, security, and design aesthetics can be difficult, and some hotels prioritize the former over the latter. </code>
 <h1 align="center">The Solution üí° - <em> The 80/20 Rule</em></h1> <br>
 <P> The 80% of the effects should come from 20% of the causes. ( not the other way around ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è )  In the context of web design, it means that a significant portion of a website's impact can be attributed to a few key elements.</P>
  <P> ‚úÖ By focusing on the most crucial aspects of the website that directly affect user experience, we can create an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Prioritize clear navigation, easily accessible information, and a seamless booking process to ensure visitors can quickly find what they need and convert into customers.</P>
  <P> ‚úÖ Investing in a visually appealing design can make a significant impact on user perception and engagement. We should focus on Utilizing modern and minimalist aesthetics, high-quality images, and a consistent color palette to create an attractive website that reflects the brand identity.</P>
  <P> ‚úÖ It's very important when we apply the 80/20 rule we will get better Performance and Speed: Optimizing our website's performance is key to providing a positive user experience. Fast-loading pages, minimal use of unnecessary scripts or plugins, and optimized images contribute to a smooth browsing experience and better search engine rankings.</P>
